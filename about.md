Hi there, my name is Robert and I'm a husband, father of three and a software developer since last 12 years. I love to automate things, programing and Clouds(computing clouds - for sure :) ).    
At my work I follow the path of the Software Craftsman (at least I do my best).    
Who is that you can ask ? In my opinion _Micah Martin_ desribed it perfectly in [this post](http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2008/09/21/definition-of-software-craftsman.html).     
I also have been doing/promoting DevOps culture since 2011. Since that I also work remotely.    
At the beginning of my career I was working as a developer later on as an operation.    
To be honest since that Im trying to search for a job/project where I would be able to connect    
my passions.    

From my day-to-day job I'm using:    

  - [_Python_](https://www.python.org/) (Flask, in the past also [_Twisted_](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)) - I have been using in a past very heavily,     
    currently I use it manily for writting handly scripts which are executed via AWS Lambda(mostly),
  - [_Go Lang_](https://golang.org/) (I have been using it since a while mostly for backend APIs and cmd line tools     
    and I need to admit that so far this is my favourite programming language. Relatively I'm in this here but very extensively improving here),
  - JavaScript and Node.js([_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/) + various of JS libraries - JS is a language I have been using     
    since I actually remember but I had never focus on it as much as I should. In a last few years it grown significantly (because of Node.js) 
    and every developer should put more focus on it,
  - PHP ([_Laravel_]() and [_Symfony_]()) - I have been doing a lot of small and really big project in this language since a last 10 years or so,
  - [_Terraform_](https://www.terraform.io/) - Im an early adopter, I have been using is since almost 3 years from now,
  - [_Packer_](https://packer.io/) - I have been using it since last 2 years or so, crucial tool for every DevOps eng.,
  - [_SaltStack_](https://saltstack.com/) - ~2 years of experiance,
  - [_Jenkins_](https://jenkins-ci.org/) (to automate processes, create pipelines but I also to automate Jenkins     
    itself - DSL, Pipeline DSL, Jenkins startup script),
  - [_Docker_](https://www.docker.com/),
  - [_Kubernetes_](https://kubernetes.io/) - I have never used it on a real production environemnt and but I would love to     
    see how it works on a real battlefield, anyway I still must to learn a lot in this area,
  - [_Serverless_](https://serverless.com/) - I have been using it mainly for preparing AWS Lambdas (Python || node.js)

Since early 2018 I have been playing heavily with GoLang and since a while also with the Kubernetes.     
Ansible is also on my list of provisioners to explore(since RedHat bought them).     

I also have around 3 years of hands on experience with _AWS_ and    
services like Lambda functions, EC2, CloudWatch, ElasticCache, Route53, S3.
