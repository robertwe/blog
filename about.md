Hey, my name is Robert and I'm a husband, father of three and a software developer.
I create amazing websites and web applications for clients from all around the World.
At the same time I also love to automate things.
At my work I follow the path of Software Craftsman (at least I do my best). Who is that you can ask ?
In my opinion _Micah Martin_ desribed it perfectly in [this post](http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2008/09/21/definition-of-software-craftsman.html).     
At at my work I use various technology mainly _GoLang_, _PHP_ (Symfony2), _Ruby_ (Ruby On Rails).
Additionally [_Jenkins_](https://jenkins-ci.org/), [_SaltStack_](https://saltstack.com/), [_Terraform_](https://www.terraform.io/) and [_Python_](https://www.python.org/) help me with automate almost every aspect of the software development cycle.
