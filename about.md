Hey, my name is Robert and Im a husband, father of three and software developer.
I create amazing websites and web applications for clients from all around the World;
At my work I follow the path of Software Craftsman (at least I do my best). Who is that you can ask ?
In my opinion _Micah Martin_ desribed it perfectly in [this post](http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2008/09/21/definition-of-software-craftsman.html).     
At at my work I use varous technology mainly _PHP_ (Symfony2), _Python_ (Twisted, Django) and _Java_ (mainly Spring4).
Currently Im discovering _Ruby_ and _Ruby on Rails_ (v4) and must say it's **amazing**.
