Hi there, my name is Robert and I'm a husband, father of three and a software developer since last 12 years. At the same time I also love to automate things.    
At my work I follow the path of the Software Craftsman (at least I do my best).    
Who is that you can ask ? In my opinion _Micah Martin_ desribed it perfectly in [this post](http://blog.8thlight.com/micah-martin/2008/09/21/definition-of-software-craftsman.html).     
I also have been doing/promoting DevOps culture since 2011. Since that I also work remotely.    
At the beginning of my career I was working as a developer later on as an operation.    
To be honest since that Im trying to search for a job/project where I would be able to connect    
my both passions (programming and systems).    

From my day-to-day job I'm using:    

  - PHP ([_Laravel_]() and [_Symfony_]()),
  - [_Python_](https://www.python.org/) (Flask, in the past also [_Twisted_](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)),
  - JavaScript([_Node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/) + various of JS libraries - recently I started     
    using Jest lib for writing tests),
  - [_Terraform_](https://www.terraform.io/),
  - [_Packer_](https://packer.io/),
  - [_SaltStack_](https://saltstack.com/),
  - [_Jenkins_](https://jenkins-ci.org/) (to automate processes, create pipelines but I also to automate Jenkins     
    itself - DSL, Pipeline DSL, Jenkins startup script),
  - [_Docker_](https://www.docker.com/),
  - [_Serverless_](https://serverless.com/)

Recently I have becoming more and more familiarly with GoLang and Kubernetes.     
Both actually makes me really impressive since I really not overcomplicated solutions.    
Ansible is also on my list of provisioners to explore(since RedHat bought them).     

I also have around 3 years of hands on experience with _AWS_ and    
services like Lambda functions, EC2, CloudWatch, ElasticCache, Route53, S3.
