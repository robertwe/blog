#### Let's write it down.
To be honest I dont remember when I actually started thinking about writing down most the solutions I found over the internet or implemented myself. 
I relized that from time to time I go back to solutions, code snippets or config files I created or modified to fulfill some specif requirements. Good is it I wrote it down somewhere, put on [Gist](https://gist.github.com/robertwe) or [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/) but what if I did not ? 
Let's say I just configured Nginx as loadbalancer and for example after a year or so I need to make something exacly the same or at last similar. What's then ? I need to go through the NGINX's documentation again or start searching over google. Sure in some case I rememeber exactly how I solved some specific problem but when it was some time ago then ...
This is the reason why I decided to create this simple blog. I hope it wont evelove to any unpredictable way. You can thing about this blog like a about my notebook. If somebody else will find my notes useful/helpfull - even better. Let's make this World better.

Have a greate day.
