## My goal for the next 2 or 3 months:
I recently found [this](http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) blog entry over the internet. Lets see how it will go :). 
In general I think this is quite good idea. Mainly because you adapt to a "routine" of writing a code (if you are not already addicted like mew :D). This is a definietely a good training for your brain. 
Here is a link to my GitHub profile: https://github.com/robertwe
So first I need to find a project :). I already contribure a little bit at Jenkins CI project but I would like to create something new, if posisble from scratch and in Rails 4.

Have a great day.
