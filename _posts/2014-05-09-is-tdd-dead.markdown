Today I watched quite interesting hangout. It was a quick (30min) discussion.
Attenders: 

* Kent Beck,
* Martin Fowler,
* David Heinemeier Hansson

Few days ago @DHH wrote some "controversial" [post](http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html) on his blog about TDD and in general presented his point of view to TDD.
As a result of that we got a huge discussion on the Twitter about TDD. Some people says that every professional should use TDD and and so on. 
As a result of that guys from **ThoughtWorks** organized this hangout.
