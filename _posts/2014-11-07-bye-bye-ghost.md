After some time I finally decided to drop Ghost and migrate to some other tool/system. <!--more-->   
_Why I did not stick with Ghost:_

   -  when I would like to put some `code` in the post Ghost formating makes me cry - simple does not work (does not mean I did not try)
   -  I got few cases when post which was looking like I wanted in admin panel after putting post online was def. not what I expected,
   -  general problems with text formatting.

_Here is a list of requirements:_

   -  something simple (no DB, no fancy intermediate layers ect.),
   -  system which allows me to focus on my problems/needs not on the tool itself,
   -  probably some _Ruby_ based solution (since this is the language now Im trying to master) with the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 
      support (rather nice to have not a real requirement),
   -  possibility to host it outside my private 'infrastructure' (Linod, OVH) (in other words something cheap or even for free)

After a quick check (okay maybe a little bit longer than I expected) I decided to give (Jekyll)[http://jekyllrb.com/] a try.
It's deadly simple, has Markdown support and can be hosted very easily on GitHub (without any charge).
Currently I need to say Im very happy with it. For my needs it seems to be perfect - it does exactly what I needed. 

Lets see after few months.
