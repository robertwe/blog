I recently noticed I actually spend a lot of money to hosting and server resources Im not using at all. Such a waste. After a small research I decided to move all my Droplets from [DigitalOcean.com](https://www.digitalocean.com/) to its competitor > [linode.com](https://www.linode.com) . I also hosted 2 sites on a separate hosting - elastichost.com which is also rather expensive. 
So I sit down and calculated how much resources do I need and for how many resources I actually pay. 
At the begining I tought that maybe the best solution would be to move everything to dedicated machine at [OVH](ovh.de) or maybe [Hetzner](hetzner.de) but in both cases this is a cost ~50-70â‚¬ per month min. Quite much I think esepcially when my sites do not have huge traffic.
I was definitely searching for something likme digitalocean.com. DO is cheap and offers a bunch of features I was looking for but:
  - when somebody tries to flood(DDOS) your droplet you are actually on your own (they do not offer any type of protection) Support in this case also seems to be powerless, no matter if this is a targeted attact or just a ricochet,
  - when you site/droplet catches some significant traffic DO got poor performance. Yes I know what Im talking about. And Im not talking ahere about 30Mb/s traffic. I even upgraded my droplet from 2GMEM to 8GMEM it did not help me much I/O was still on a low level (but still DO looks better than most of VPS hostings)
  - it's a pitty they do not offer some more extensive monitoring out of the box
 
 So why Linode:
  - for the same price I can get more powerfull vistual machine and more disk space 
  - looks like they got better I/O performance (I will try to provide some stats to proof that)
  - quick and helpfull support - dont gent me wrong DO support is also damn quick but Linode support seems to be more tekkie oriented
  - better monitoring "LongView"


In general I dont think DO is bad, I think it's simple suited for other purposes like test evn or dev env.

After the migration preformance increased significantly. 
It was visible quite much especially on the Redmine tool side.
